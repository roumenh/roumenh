# Hello everyone, welcome to my github!
There are not many updates as recently I do not have that much time for pet-projects, since I am full time working on Android stuff these days, unfortunatelly, I cannot share the code :)
So here are some old(er) projects that I worked on in my rather junior stage :)

## Alihopa (adaptation of a Swedish word: altogether)
Project in the beginnings. My main aim is to become fluent in Clean Architecture principles, MVVM and to learn a lot of new stuff whilst working on this project.

The app should serve as a simple social connector for groups (crews) of people that tend to meet at a particular place (eg. at pub, in the park). Every day the user is prompted for his/hers attendance (going, tentative or no). Then other group members will see if someone has time to go out and the crew can finally gather. This app will use no user accounts.

## Weather Check 2000
https://github.com/roumenh/WeatherCheck2000
App where you can add a city (with its latitude and longitude) and then see what is the current weather (state, temperature, wind orientation and speed) and forecast (temperatures low and highg). There are still things to finetune in this project (single source of truth, some things are not really used correctly), but it is a small and usable app that I personally check every day on my phone. I am still planning on improving it. It uses Coil, Retrofit, Moshi and other libraries.

## Google Books Search
https://github.com/roumenh/googleBooksSearch
Small app connected to Google Books API, that can search by author for books written in Czech language. With list of books and detail.

## Mamka Appka
https://github.com/roumenh/MamkaAppka
This is very basic and imperfect app for my mum (for Christmas) and it shows her every day new photo with a quote. It connects to a very basic API endpoint that I wrote in PHP (I am no master in PHP). Photos are stored on server and it all is organized inside MySQL database. User can access the photos and quotes from the past. Photos and qoutes are added via simple upload form. My mum loves this app! But I am always late with adding the pictures :-(
